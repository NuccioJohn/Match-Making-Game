## Overview

I believe tha game meets all the requirements. I was hoping to add animations and finish a clock feature before I turned it in though. Also i didn't realize that i needed to make a README until I reviewed the requirements with just an hour left. So sorry if the readme comes off sparse. 

##Time
The player has a 180 seconds to play the game before they lose the game. THe timer starts as soon as the player makes their first move. If time runs out the player will lose the game and is notified.

## Futrue time implementation
I was planning to use the clock to keep track of the seconds and shake and turn red when the player got below 40 seconds of time remaining.

##Moves
The player will lose Stars based on moves alone. If the player loses their last star then the player will lose the game and is notified of the loss. 

##Future Move Implmentation
I am planning to add animations for when the player loses stars.

## JavaScript
I used the base JavaScript to make the tile arangment random. I think I could probably manage my functions better and probably could tighten things up a it more. I definitely probably could maintain my setInterval destruction logic better. I hope to improve these things on my own.

I put the lock JavaScript into its own file. 

##HTML
I used the base HTML and really didn't do too much to change it.

##CSS
THe biggest CSS changes I made was making the game scale with @Media and adding the CSS to make the little Analog clock.

##sweetalert
I added the dependency Sweet Alert which can be found at the bottom of the index.html page: <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/sweetalert/dist/sweetalert.min.js"></script>

##sweetalert
I made the Analog Clock from a lynda.com tutorial, I am going to modify it in my next iteration of the game.
